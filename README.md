# Falcon 1 Rocket 2DOF Modelling
Modelling of the Falcon 1 rocket powered by the Space-X Merlin -1 C engine for landing and takeoff via the Matlab-Simulink program. It is a model of how to perform a full flight simulation of the takeoff and landing of a rocket. I aim to check how a gravity rotation works, the deorbit descent stage, boost buck and input burn, and the tilt angle for a vertical descent. It was assumed that a single-stage rocket took off and landed. I have defined the thrust and friction force as a function. I've determined varying gamma angles on takeoff and landing. I tried to create a pitch controller.
